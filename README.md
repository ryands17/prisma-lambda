# CDK + Prisma

This is integrating Prisma with `aws-lambda-nodejs` to run Prisma on Lambda

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

Replace `region` in `cdk.context.json` to the one of your choice.

## Useful commands

- `yarn build` compile typescript to js
- `yarn watch` watch for changes and compile
- `yarn test` perform the jest unit tests
- `yarn cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `yarn cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `yarn cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
